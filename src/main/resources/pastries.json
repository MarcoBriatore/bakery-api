It is then kneaded and opened once more, before being formed into a roll and left to repose as such for a further period of several hours. When the tissue of the paste is still soft but about to detach into pieces, it is cut into small balls and put in rows of small pans and marinaded in vegetable oil between half an hour and one hour.

The Kipferl¬†‚Äì ancestor of the croissant¬†‚Äì has been documented in Austria going back at least as far as the 13th century, in various shapes.[24] The Kipferl can be made plain or with nut or other fillings (some consider the rugelach a form of Kipferl). The \"birth\" of the croissant itself¬†‚Äì that is, its adaptation from the plainer form of Kipferl, before its subsequent evolution (to a puff pastry)¬†‚Äì can be dated with some precision to at latest 1839 (some say 1838), when an Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded a Viennese Bakery (\"Boulangerie Viennoise\") at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris.[25] This bakery, which served Viennese specialities including the Kipferl and the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French imitators (and the concept, if not the term, viennoiserie, a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style pastries). The French version of the Kipferl was named for its crescent (croissant) shape."

A cookbook published in Catalan in 1520, the Libre del Coch by Ruperto de Nola, mentions empanadas filled with seafood among its recipes of Catalan, Italian, French, and Arabian food.[34][35] In turn, it is believed that empanadas and the similar calzones are both derived from the Indian meat-filled pies, samosas.[36]"

When baked, the crust acquires a rich, shiny, golden-brown exterior, which is fairly crisp and water-resistant. This allows the pies to be filled with a savoury jelly or gravy as they cool, often through a central hole in the crust made expressly for the purpose during raising."

The filling is always placed as a lump in the middle of the bottom dough layer, rather than spread on it, because it would then liquefy and leak during baking. The pie is traditionally finished with a distinct shine to the top of the crust, by egg-washing beforehand, or by caramelising a dusting of confectioner's sugar at the end of baking, or both. Whilst the filling of the Pithivier is often a sweet frangipane of almond paste, (optionally combined with fruit such as cherry or plum), savory pies with a meat or cheese filling can also be termed as a Pithivier."

The main ingredients are flour, eggs, sugar, butter, cream, and plum schnaps. To give it the characteristic shape the dough is rolled out and cut with a dough cutter into even strips. The strips are then arranged alternately over and under a stick, or the handle of a wooden spoon. Eventually the stick is lifted and slowly removed while the dough stripes are formed into a loose ball. Using a special holder called a Schneeballeneisen in order to retain the shape, the ball is deep-fried in boiling fat until golden brown, and finally dusted with confectioner's sugar while still warm."
